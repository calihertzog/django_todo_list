A to-do list is a very convenient and effective way of laying out tasks. This to-do list application, created using Django, helps the user to cleanly assign due dates to tasks and tasks to lists.

The user can create multiple lists and customize the name.

If a list is clicked on, the tasks are shown alongside the due date.  The order of the tasks are determined by this date (soonest due date at the top).

If a list is created, but does not have any tasks yet, the user can add them.

The user can add as many tasks as they would like.  Each task can have its own title, description, and due date.
